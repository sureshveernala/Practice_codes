Technical aspects:
	I am an electrical student so i thought that i can't do coding, so learnt only few methods in python which are useful for campus drives. After coming here i got many technical skills which were useful for career.
1. I learnt instruction flows. These increased logical thinking capability and formed few patterns to solve the problems.
2. I learnt C language in depth. By using instruction flows C became easy to learn.
3. In the learning period of C i am team leader of my team. I learnt so many things: 
    1. I learnt to manage the team.
    2. I started  to understand the problems of others and where they lag.
    3. I clarified so many doubts until they understood the concept.
    4. By helping my team i got improved and my capability on solving coding problems was increased.
4. I started to clarify the doubts and explaining how to approach a problem in accomodation rooms, so day by day it became my habit for few days. after few days my skills improved.
