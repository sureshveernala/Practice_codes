communication aspects:

In intial training progress
1) I understood the communication importance in life.
2) I learnt how to talk with people.
3) I learnt how people behave.
4) I learnt how to understand others.
5) I understood the meaning of a good relation
6) I broke resistances like my laziness in mornings and going for sessions daily.
    My learnings changed my behaviour and character. My friends observed a lot of changes in me. In college i wasted soo much time in watching movies, playing games and parties, So my friends got shocked after they knowing that i am going to sessions without any leaves.
