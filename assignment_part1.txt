communication aspects:

In intial training progress
1. I understood the communication importance in life.
2. I learnt how to talk with people.
3. I learnt how people behave.
4. I learnt how to understand others.
5. I broke resistances like my laziness in mornings and going for sessions daily.
6. I habituated  going for sessions 5 mins earlier then the timings.
7. My angriness decreased when i started i understanding peoples behaviour.
8. Visualisation technic made me more happier and i started focus on actual things.


	My learnings changed my behaviour and character. My friends observed a lot of changes in me. In college i wasted soo much time in watching movies, playing games and parties, So my friends got shocked after they knowing that i am going to sessions without any leaves and for way of my communication.
